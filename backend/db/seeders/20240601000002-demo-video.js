The transverse abdominis is located in the abdomen immediately inside of the internal oblique muscle. It is one of the innermost muscles of the abdomen. Just like the other core muscles, the main roles of the transverse abdominis is to protect the internal organs by holding them in place, and also support the torso by maintaining abdominal wall tension that stabilizes the spine. Coach Zach is going to show you three different methods of strengthening and tightening the TVA muscle. Not only will this change you're physique, and give you a slimmer tighter waist. This will also strengthen core stability muscles, and alleviate back pain and tightness. `,

The muscle is contracted and flexed, but there will be no visible movement of the joint. This is a great way to apply tension to the muscles without going through the full range of motion. Often times you'll see this technique used in physical therapy. Isometric exercises improve physical endurance by strengthening and stabilizing the muscle.`,

    description: `Guys want muscular legs and girls want guys to have muscular legs...that's a fact! In order to fully develop the upper inner thigh area, it is critical to think about activating the adductors since they are such a large muscle group in the leg...and most guys don't even realize how big and vital this muscle group is! Most guys continue to work in one plane of motion and neglect to incorporate movements that fully fire the supporting muscles. These 6 inner thigh exercises are actually very similar to what you're probably already doing...just with some needed tweaks to make them more 'inner thigh' approved. Strength Coach Brian Klepacki, MS, CSCS demonstrates all of the inner thigh exercises for you. Don't try to do them all in one workout. Pick one exercise or maybe two to perform in a workout, do 3-5 sets with moderate weight and rotate through all 6 exercises. I bet inside 30-60 days of doing these moves consistently, you will have trouble pulling those jeans on over those thicker, more muscular thighs.`,
